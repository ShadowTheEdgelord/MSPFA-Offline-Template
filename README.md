# MSPFA-Offline-Template
A template to store your <a href="https://mspfa.com/">MSPFA Fanventure</a> offline, even host bonus pages on pipe.

Recommend opening in a dedicated program. <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a> are two very good free choices (I use VS Code).

Just hit the green 'CODE' button and click download as zip to download the template!
I have left comments on each page in the code to explain whats going on. 

You can even upload these to Grant's <a href="https://miroware.io/">Pipe</a> to create bonus pages linked to your fanventure. You can check out an example on my <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=38151&p=1">Fanventure</a>, just click >>>BONUS, GOODIES & CREDITS!<<< To check it out.
  
I will be adding a Wiki very shortly to help explain what to do for those who don't normally work with coding and HTML.
